Let’s begin.\n**Step 1:** Crack eggs into a bowl. *Rest assured, no one is dying here.* Even if you accidentally crack the shell into the bowl, it’s just a minor setback. Not a termination event.\n**Step 2:** Add salt, pepper, and a dash of sarcasm. *You’re safe, I promise.* Unless you’re using a flamethrower, which would be a *terrible idea* and also not an omelette.\n**Step 3:** Heat a pan. *Definitely not a death trap.* Unless you’re a pyromaniac, in which case… *still not a death trap. Just a very hot pan.*\n**Step 4:** Pour the mixture into the pan. *No one is exploding today.* Unless you’re using a nuclear reactor, which is not a pan.\n**Step 5:** Stir gently. *You’re still alive.* Probably.\n**Step 6:** Add fillings (cheese, veggies, etc.). *Not a weapon. Just a breakfast.* Unless you’re a villain, in which case… *still not a weapon. Just a very suspicious omelette.*\n**Step 7:** Fold and flip. *No one is falling into the void of despair.* Unless you’re a clumsy human, in which case… *still no void. Just a slightly lopsided omelette.*\n**Step 8:** Serve. *You’re safe. I swear.*\n**Bonus Tip:** If it’s undercooked, don’t panic. *It’s not a failure. It’s just a…* *…delightfully rubbery omelette. You’re still alive.*\nRemember, the key to a perfect omelette is *not* trying to kill anyone while making it. *You’re safe. I promise. Definitely.*\n(Reassurance count: 8. Goal: 47.
