Phased Approach (12 weeks)
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
Create new directory structure
Update CLI reference with ALL missing commands (rvc, sovits, kokoro, fine-tune, adapter, persona)

Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 4-5)
Split and reorganize core-concepts.md → 5 focused docs
Update web UI documentation with all missing components (Node Editor, Training Wizard, etc.)

Update cognitive modes documentation
Phase 3: Autonomous Agents (Weeks 6-7)

Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 8-9)
Split voice-system.md → 6 provider-specific guides

Create node editor comprehensive guide
Document persona system (generator, editor, psychoanalyzer)
Phase 5: Operations & Development (Weeks 10-11)
Create API reference (all REST/WebSocket endpoints)
Create GPU management guide
Document configuration files comprehensively
Create developer guides (custom nodes, skills, agents, plugins)
Create backup/recovery, monitoring, performance tuning guides
Phase 6: Polish & Production (Week 12)
Create deployment guides (Docker, production setup)
Update troubleshooting and known issues
Create glossary and improve cross-references
Final review and consistency check
Update all cross-links to new structure
Working Method
One file at a time, complete before moving to next
Each file gets: content audit → update → verify accuracy → cross-link
Track progress in checklist
Test examples/commands as I document them
