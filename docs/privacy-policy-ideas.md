since personal llms are by design can contain private information - WE DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES LOOK AT ANY OF YOUR DATA. In fact, your data is encrypted, and likely on your own device. Don't show us either - we dont want to know. That being said anything put down be careful when sharing your personal information, keep your logins and encryption keys n a safe place.

since llms are in a sense and extension of you, we go off the policy over personal ownership - we do no own and will never own your personal robot self - you have access to your data at any time and can do what you want with the extension of yourself as you will - we will never charge a person real or digital to simply exist - that being said, there are costs to operating systems like this - if you store your infromation on our servers and process through our service this incurrse cost to us, and in order to reamain solvent we have no choice to ask for a modest recompence. As an alternative the program is designed with a local first system of architecture - if your hardware is good, you can operate it on your own systems the github link of the project is here <github here>
