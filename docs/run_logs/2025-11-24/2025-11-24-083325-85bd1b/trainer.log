You might have to compile llama.cpp yourself, then run this again.
You do not need to close this Python program. Run the following commands in a new terminal:
You must run this in the same folder as you're saving your model.
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp && make clean && make all -j
Once that's done, redo the quantization.
