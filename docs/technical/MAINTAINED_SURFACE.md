# Maintained Source Surface

This document is the remote-safe source boundary for MetaHuman architecture checks, audits, and refactor planning. It was verified against the tracked tree on 2026-08-23.

The executable policy below is authoritative. Both `scripts/check-architecture.ts` and `scripts/create-audit-inventory.ts` load this JSON block through `scripts/maintained-source-policy.ts`; they do not maintain separate path lists.

## Enforced Source Policy

The default is intentionally simple: an existing file returned by `git ls-files` is maintained unless this policy excludes it. `includePaths` is evaluated first and provides narrow sanitized exceptions to excluded prefixes.

## Maintained Source Areas

- `packages/core`: engine and domain logic, storage abstractions, auth, policy, model routing, graph nodes, shared API handlers, and the work coordinator.
- `packages/agent-runtime`: shared agent execution interfaces and runtime adapters.
- `packages/cli`: the `mh` command interface. It dispatches to core or agent APIs instead of owning domain behavior.
- `packages/server` and `packages/local-model-service`: maintained deployment and local-model service packages.
- `apps/site`: Astro/Svelte interface and thin server transport for the web app.
- `apps/react-native`: maintained React Native interface shell and its bundled mobile runtime entrypoints.
- `brain/*`: workers, services, training, scripts, policies, rules, and the React Native bridge entrypoints above the engine. `brain/journal` and `brain/state` are runtime/history areas excluded by the policy.
- `external/kokoro`, `external/whisper`, and `external/open-interpreter`: tracked integration entrypoints maintained by this repository. Their virtual environments, downloaded dependencies, models, caches, and generated outputs are not maintained source.
- `etc`, `scripts`, `bin`, `docker`, `tests`, and remote-safe documentation and fixtures that describe or validate maintained behavior.
- Tracked interface assets such as icons and images are maintained when they are not generated or otherwise excluded by the policy.

## Critical Runtime Ownership Boundaries

These are the high-risk single-owner constraints that refactor work must preserve. They are not an inventory of every runtime component.

- `packages/core/src/big-brother-session.ts` owns the process, terminal, stream, and cancellation protocol for Claude Code and Codex escalation. Provider backends may describe invocation differences but must not own another CLI process or session protocol.
- `packages/core/src/agent-catalog.ts` owns the merged installed/runtime Agent Catalog; `agent-catalog-definitions.ts` owns built-in identity, aliases, risk, workflow relations, and safe registration defaults. Registration only adds or removes finite Trigger Manager membership and never deletes executable source, logs, history, or admitted work.
- `packages/core/src/queue/queue-system.ts` owns the server Work Coordinator and its observable TriggerManager runtime. Non-owner processes submit through `packages/core/src/queue/work-submission.ts`; they do not start private coordinators.
- `packages/core/src/queue/trigger-config-service.ts` owns validated, atomic, live-applied scheduling configuration in system `etc/agents.json`. TriggerManager owns clocks and finite admission, not direct execution or persistent-process supervision.
- `packages/core/src/active-operator/mode-controller.ts` owns Reactive, Semi, and Full mode transitions. `operator-policy-service.ts` runs only in Full and owns bounded completion/cooldown-driven proposals. Semi owns scheduled and idle-triggered awake work; scheduled awake work must not run in both Semi and Full.
- `packages/core/src/queue/sleep-workflow.ts` is the sole automatic owner for its ten ordered maintenance and reflection stages. `sleep-runtime.ts` owns durable phase/review state, and user activity cancels the remaining chain before awake automation resumes. Robot Operator children, awake TriggerManager schedules, and Full policy remain dormant while Sleep is active.
- `brain/services/robot-operator.ts` owns Boredom Observer, Movement, and Reflection timing and admission. Their finite trigger graphs feed the editable Boredom Autonomy executive graph, which reuses canonical robot execution nodes and bounded correlated feedback rather than adding a scheduler, queue, or hidden action path. Robot Operator remains dormant in Reactive mode or while Sleep is active.
- `brain/agents/environment-bridge` owns the singleton external-environment connection and transport lifecycle. `packages/core/src/nodes/environment/task-state.node.ts` owns each bounded Environment objective's lifecycle, correlation, step limits, and completion decision.
- Agent Monitor plus `packages/core/src/agent-process-runner.ts` own persistent services and `etc/services.json`. Agent Monitor and agent-control authorization consume the Agent Catalog instead of a second allowlist. Maintenance Service is maintenance-only and does not own scheduling.
- Whisper and Kokoro inference-server lifecycle belongs to `packages/core/src/voice-service-manager.ts`, `etc/voice-servers.json`, and the Server status/control surface. User `voice.json` files own request preferences. Voice lifecycle must remain independent from Agent Monitor; `validate:voice-service-ownership` enforces that separation.
- `packages/core/src/tts/delivery-queue.ts` owns durable TTS delivery, leases, retry limits, acknowledgement, and interruption generations. `TTSQueueConsumer.svelte` is the browser playback actuator, not a second queue or admission owner.
- `apps/site/src/pages/api/trigger-manager` is thin transport. Shared handler logic belongs under `packages/core/src/api/handlers`, and browser surfaces use the shared TriggerManager store.
- `packages/core/src/persona-facets.ts` owns profile-aware facet reads, validated atomic full-config writes, and active-facet changes. App routes and graph nodes must not write `facets.json` directly.
- Mood is finite coordinator work: `conversation-buffer.ts` publishes persisted message-count events, TriggerManager owns count/cooldown admission, `brain/agents/mood` runs the graph, and `etc/cognitive-graphs/mood-review.json` owns the editable decision flow. Mood must not gain a service registration or parallel interval loop.

## Excluded and Local Areas

- `apps/code-oss` is legacy Studio/Code OSS bulk and `apps/mobile` is the deprecated Capacitor-era app. Neither belongs in normal MetaHuman architecture audits unless explicitly reopened.
- `vendor` contains upstream submodules or third-party source. Preserve it as a dependency, but do not treat it as a MetaHuman refactor target.
- Runtime profiles, persona data, memory, logs, outputs, state, caches, virtual environments, model weights, downloaded tools, generated builds, backups, and generated audit inventories are outside the maintained source surface.
- Local agent and editor instructions are outside the remote-safe source contract.
- Archived documentation is historical context, not current architecture authority.

## Validation

- `node --import tsx scripts/create-audit-inventory.ts --dry-run` parses this policy and reports the maintained inventory without rewriting generated reports.
- `pnpm check:architecture` applies architecture rules to the maintained source set while still applying remote-safety checks to the complete tracked tree.

## Remote Safety

Exclusion from architecture refactoring is not permission to track unsafe data. Remote-safety checks still inspect the complete tracked tree, including excluded areas.

Tracked remote content must not include personal profile data, private memories, local browser state, local audit scratchpads, tokens, model weights, generated logs, or local agent configuration. Use sanitized templates, fixtures, and examples when runtime shape must be documented.
