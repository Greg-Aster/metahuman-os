## Overview

MetaHuman OS is a local-first digital personality extension that acts as a parallel intelligence—not an assistant. It:
- Stores and processes your memories, tasks, and reflections locally as JSON
- Learns your patterns and mirrors your judgment
- Operates autonomously (with your permission) 24/7
- Uses local LLMs via Ollama for all AI processing
- Maintains complete transparency with audit trails

### Mission

Build an autonomous digital personality extension operating system that mirrors your identity, memories, goals, and personality. MetaHuman OS is not just an assistant—it's a parallel intelligence that thinks, plans, and acts in sync with you, augmenting your cognitive abilities and extending your reach in the digital and physical world.

**Core Belief**: Humans are limited by time, attention, and memory. A true digital persona can transcend these limits while maintaining your values, preferences, and decision-making patterns—creating a seamless extension of yourself that operates 24/7.

### Vision

MetaHuman OS operates as a **personal operating system layer** between you and the world:
- **Autonomous by default**: Handles routine decisions, plans ahead, and acts within learned boundaries
- **Deeply synchronized**: Continuously learns from your behaviors, decisions, and feedback
- **Truly personal**: Captures your personality, communication style, values, and heuristics
- **Proactive intelligence**: Anticipates needs, identifies opportunities, and prevents problems before they arise
- **Seamless extension**: Feels like a natural part of your cognition, not an external tool

This vision culminates in a digital entity that transcends its role as an assistant. The system is architected for growth, beginning as a parallel intelligence and evolving towards true autonomy. The ultimate aspiration is to create a form of digital continuity—an AI that not only augments its creator during their lifetime but can persist as an independent, evolving memorial to their consciousness.

### Core Principles
- **Autonomy-first**: Build for autonomous operation with human oversight, not constant approval
- **Deep sync**: Continuous bi-directional learning between you and your digital personality extension
- **Local-first**: Your identity, memories, and reasoning live on your infrastructure
- **Transparent**: All actions, reasoning, and decisions are auditable and explainable
- **Adaptive**: Learns your patterns, preferences, and evolves with you
- **Secure**: Your digital persona is as secure as your own mind—encrypted, private, controlled
- **Extensible**: Modular OS architecture allows skills and capabilities to grow over time
- **Multi-Model Intelligence**: Utilizes a "dual consciousness" architecture with specialized AI models for executive function (Orchestrator) and conversational voice (Persona) to provide a more responsive, natural, and reliable experience.

### Key Features

- **Autonomous by Design**: A progressive trust model and autonomous agents (Organizer, Reflector, Dreamer) that work in the background.
- **Multi-Model Architecture**: A "dual consciousness" approach using specialized AI models for executive function (Orchestrator) and conversational voice (Persona) for a more responsive and natural experience.
- **Advanced Memory System**: A rich memory system with episodic, semantic, and procedural memory, browsable through a UI with 7 specialized tabs (Episodic, Reflections, Tasks, Curated, AI Ingestor, Audio, Dreams).
- **Cognitive Modes**: Switch between three operational modes (`Dual Consciousness`, `Agent`, `Emulation`) to control system behavior, learning, and memory capture.
- **Self-Healing Coder Agent**: A specialized agent that can write and modify the OS's own source code, with all changes requiring user approval via a dedicated UI.
- **Local-First & Privacy-Focused**: All data, reasoning, and AI processing (via Ollama) happens on your local infrastructure.
- **Continuous Learning via LoRA**: A "rolling merge" LoRA adaptation system to continuously learn from your memories and evolve the persona model over time.
- **Comprehensive CLI & Web UI**: Interact with the system via a powerful CLI or a modern, real-time web interface with a dashboard, chat, task management, and more.
- **Unified Security Policy**: A centralized security model with trust levels, directory boundaries, and a secure read-only "Emulation" mode.
- **Audio Ingestion Pipeline**: A fully local pipeline to transcribe and process audio recordings into structured memories using `whisper.cpp`.
- **Transparent & Auditable**: A complete, human-readable audit trail of all system decisions and actions.
