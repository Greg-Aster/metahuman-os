## Overview

MetaHuman OS is a local-first digital personality extension that acts as a parallel intelligence—not an assistant. It:
- Stores and processes your memories, tasks, and reflections locally as JSON
- Learns your patterns and mirrors your judgment
- Operates autonomously (with your permission) 24/7
- Uses local LLMs via Ollama for all AI processing
- Maintains complete transparency with audit trails

### Mission

Build an autonomous digital personality extension operating system that mirrors your identity, memories, goals, and personality. MetaHuman OS is not just an assistant—it's a parallel intelligence that thinks, plans, and acts in sync with you, augmenting your cognitive abilities and extending your reach in the digital and physical world.

**Core Belief**: Humans are limited by time, attention, and memory. A true digital persona can transcend these limits while maintaining your values, preferences, and decision-making patterns—creating a seamless extension of yourself that operates 24/7.

### Vision

MetaHuman OS operates as a **personal operating system layer** between you and the world:
- **Autonomous by default**: Handles routine decisions, plans ahead, and acts within learned boundaries
- **Deeply synchronized**: Continuously learns from your behaviors, decisions, and feedback
- **Truly personal**: Captures your personality, communication style, values, and heuristics
- **Proactive intelligence**: Anticipates needs, identifies opportunities, and prevents problems before they arise
- **Seamless extension**: Feels like a natural part of your cognition, not an external tool

### Core Principles
- **Autonomy-first**: Build for autonomous operation with human oversight, not constant approval
- **Deep sync**: Continuous bi-directional learning between you and your digital personality extension
- **Local-first**: Your identity, memories, and reasoning live on your infrastructure
- **Transparent**: All actions, reasoning, and decisions are auditable and explainable
- **Adaptive**: Learns your patterns, preferences, and evolves with you
- **Secure**: Your digital persona is as secure as your own mind—encrypted, private, controlled
- **Extensible**: Modular OS architecture allows skills and capabilities to grow over time
