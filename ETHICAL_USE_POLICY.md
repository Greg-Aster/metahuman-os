## Ethical Principles

### 1. Authenticity

MetaHuman OS is designed for **authentic self-extension**, not deception:
- Your digital persona should represent **you**
- It should operate transparently within boundaries you define
- It should not pretend to be someone it is not

### 2. Consent & Privacy

Respect the consent and privacy of others:
- Do not train models on others' data without permission
- Do not use the system to surveil, track, or intrude on others
- Respect communication boundaries and preferences

### 3. Autonomy & Control

You remain in control:
- Your persona operates within trust levels **you define**
- You can override, pause, or shut down autonomous behavior at any time
- The system serves **you**, not the other way around

### 4. Harm Reduction

Use MetaHuman OS to **enhance human capability**, not to harm:
- Consider the potential consequences of autonomous actions
- Set appropriate trust boundaries for sensitive operations
- Monitor and audit your persona's behavior
- Take responsibility for outcomes

## Your Commitment

By checking the box, you affirm that you will:

✅ **NOT impersonate any individual without their express consent**

✅ **NOT create malicious AI systems designed to harm others**

## Philosophy

MetaHuman OS is built on the principle that **AI should augment human agency, not replace or deceive humanity**.

Your digital persona is an **extension of you**—a tool to amplify your capability, preserve your knowledge, and operate within boundaries you define.

Use it wisely. Use it ethically. Use it to **enhance human flourishing**, not to undermine it.
