# Metahuman Trainer – .env template

# Required: RunPod API token
# Get from RunPod dashboard → API Keys
RUNPOD_API_KEY=

# Optional: RunPod Template ID to deploy pods from
# Create one in RunPod dashboard using an image like
#   runpod/pytorch:1.0.2-cu1281-torch280-ubuntu2404
# Ensure:
# - Public IP enabled
# - SSH (TCP 22) published publicly
# - Your SSH public key is installed via UI or startup script
# If unset, the agent falls back to a built-in template id.
RUNPOD_TEMPLATE_ID=

# Optional: Force direct SSH user (skips probing root/unsloth)
# Example: RUNPOD_DIRECT_SSH_USER=root
RUNPOD_DIRECT_SSH_USER=

# Optional: Disable gateway discovery attempts (reduces GraphQL 400s noise)
# Set to 1 to skip schema probes entirely and rely on direct SSH via public IP:22.
# Example: RUNPOD_NO_GATEWAY=1
RUNPOD_NO_GATEWAY=

# Notes:
# - Do NOT put ssh_key_path here. The agent reads it from the per-run
#   connection.json under metahuman-runs/<DATE>/connection.json.
# - Copy this file to .env and fill values. .env is gitignored.
